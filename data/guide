[section Introduction]

[bold Tsun] is an artistic constructed language that was created for the purpose of writing lyrics and poetry.
It is a highly [italic analytic language] (as opposed to synthetic) that features no inflections whatsoever.
Each word matches one out of two possible simple consonant/vowel patterns, both of which are only one syllable.
This makes [bold Tsun] a [italic monosyllabic language].
However, unlike all natural monosyllabic languages it is [italic atonal] so the lexicon is actually quite limited and would require phonological modifications or multi-syllable words to support more than 1710 words.

I doubt that I am ever going to hit that limit, though, so it is not a problem at this point.

[section Phonology]

The primary goal was to find a balance between phonological simplicity and the maximum number of words supported by the syllable patterns.
I tried to pick phonemes based on their popularity in the UPSID data to have a solid basis in naturally occurring frequencies and contrasts.

While tonality is an interesting feature and very much suited for a monosyllabic language it is difficult to realise for the type of music it was developed for.
Black metal and death metal primarily rely on high pitched/low pitched growls which are not easy to apply tonality to.

[bold Tsun] has 9 vowels and 26 consonants, 4 of which are affricates.
It also features 6 diphthongs, all of which are composed of two of the regular single vowels.
The length of the vowels is not important.
Here is an overview of the basic vowels:

This set of vowels was somewhat inspired by the phonology of [italic Standard Tibetan], so while the contrasts might seem poor, they do exist in a similar fashion in some natural languages.
I wish I could have used a more reduced set of vowels, 9 is quite a bit.
It was necessary to get a sufficient number of possible syllables to make the upper limit for the size of the lexicon more tolerable.

The 6 diphthongs are:

[list
[item ia]
[item iu]
[item ai]
[item au]
[item ui]
[item ua]
]

They are necessary to increase the number of combinations.
I tried to keep them simple, though.
The contrasts on these is considerable and should make it easy enough to identify them by sound.
The initial [ipa i] and the [ipa u] in these forced me to get rid of the approximants [ipa j] and [ipa w].

[section Syllable structure]

Syllables consist of an initial consonant, followed by a vowel or a diphthong and an optional final consonant.
The pattern is designed to form a [italic self-segregating morphology] so you can easily determine syllable boundaries (even though it is monosyllabic).

[list
[item Initial consonants: plosives, approximants, initial fricatives, taps, stops, affricates]
[item Vowel cluster: vowel, diphthong]
[item Optional final consonant: nasals, final fricatives]
]

The initial fricatives are [ipa h] and [ipa K], the final fricatives are the remaining ones.
I put the [ipa h] at the beginning because it seems like a weak choice for a final and does not occur in that position in many languages, while it is still a very popular phoneme overall.
While [ipa K] is a candidate for a final, I consider it related to [ipa l] and would like to keep them in the same position.
In an older version of the phonology [ipa l] actually used to be a final, but I gave up on that.

This results in the following phonemes:

[list
[item Initial consonants: k, p, t, g, b, d, l, h, [xsampa K], [xsampa 4], [xsampa ?], ts, dz, [xsampa tS], [xsampa dZ] (15 possibilities)]
[item Vowel cluster: i, a, u, [xsampa E], e, [xsampa O], o, [xsampa @], y, ia, iu, ai, au, ui, ua (15 possibilities)]
[item Optional final consonant: n, [xsampa N], m, f, s, [xsampa S], x, v, z, [xsampa Z], [xsampa G] (11 possibilities)]
]

This results in 225 short syllables, 1485 long ones and hence a total word count of up to 1710.
The short syllables are used for more important frequently used words while the long ones form the majority of the lexicon.
